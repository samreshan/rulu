summary: "Transformed a complex data product into a guided operating system that lifted activation by 38%."
logline: "Reframed Flowwise from a dashboard into a clarity tool that helps revenue teams act on the right signals."
context: "Flowwise was drowning users in charts without context. Founders needed a way to turn their machine-learning insights into daily workflows."
strategy: "Align the product around critical revenue questions, build a systems model for the data, and introduce progressive guidance that met teams where they worked."
reflection: "Clarity comes from sequencing the experience. When we choreograph the right next step, teams feel momentum — not overwhelm."

### Mapping the revenue nervous system

We started with field research — embedding with revenue analysts, customer success, and ops. Each team used a different spreadsheet to answer the same question: *Where should we focus today?* The existing product mirrored the data warehouse; it needed to mirror decisions.

I facilitated alignment sessions with the founders to model the revenue system. We named the primary signals, defined leading indicators, and mapped how decisions cascaded between teams. That map became the backbone for the new experience.

### Designing guided clarity

Rather than a single dashboard, we prototyped "scenarios" — narrative flows that surfaced the signal, explained the insight, and offered the best next move. We used progressive disclosure: start with the headline, then invite the user deeper. Motion reinforced focus with subtle crossfades and sticky context panels.

### Operationalizing the system

We partnered with engineering to create a schema that tied each scenario to data contracts. Design tokens ensured parity between product and embedded BI surfaces. Workshops with customer teams introduced rituals: a daily clarity stand-up powered by Flowwise.

### Launch and iteration

We shipped the MVP to two pilot teams, instrumented the flows, and ran weekly clarity labs to capture qualitative feedback. Iterations focused on reducing friction: contextual tooltips, shortcut actions, and a new "focus" state saved to Slack. Within six weeks activation jumped, and leadership expanded the rollout across the company.
