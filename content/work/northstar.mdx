summary: "Unified a fragmented healthcare experience with a brand and product system that increased patient retention by 22%."
logline: "Reimagined Northstar’s brand and product as one calm, navigable journey from symptom to support."
context: "Northstar’s telehealth service grew fast, but the brand, onboarding, and care portal felt disconnected. Patients churned before completing their first visit."

reflection: "When the brand, product, and service speak with one voice, patients feel held — and teams operate from shared truth."

### Listening inside the system

We interviewed patients, clinicians, and care coordinators to map the emotional highs and lows of seeking care. Patients described the process as "a maze." Teams inside Northstar confirmed the fragmentation: marketing promised calm, but product flows felt transactional.

I synthesized the research into a journey map and identified three pivotal moments: discovery, diagnosis, and ongoing support. Each moment needed a consistent voice and clear guidance.

### Crafting a cohesive narrative

We built a brand platform anchored in the idea of "quiet confidence." Typography paired a modern grotesk with a humanist serif; color contrasted deep night with warm ivory and an electric pulse of vermilion for moments of action. Motion guidelines ensured every interaction felt like a gentle inhale-exhale.

### Designing the care experience

In the product, we reframed onboarding as a conversation. We added contextual stories from clinicians, milestone trackers, and embedded care team intros. The service blueprint aligned operations, showing who owned each moment and the tools they needed.

### Enabling the organization

We launched a brand and product playbook, trained internal squads, and created a component library that spanned marketing, product, and support. Post-launch metrics showed retention and NPS climbing, while support tickets dropped because patients finally understood what was next.
