summary: "Built a decision platform for a logistics startup that cut exception handling time in half."
logline: "Gave operations teams a living map of the supply chain so they could intervene before issues snowballed."
context: "Orion’s teams managed shipments across four countries using email threads and static dashboards. Data lag meant exceptions were caught after customers complained."
strategy: "Design a shared operating picture, automate signal triage, and choreograph human handoffs with clear accountability."
reflection: "Systems thinking turns chaos into choreography. When everyone sees the same map, action becomes obvious."
impact:
  - label: "Exception handling"
    value: "−52% time"
  - label: "On-time deliveries"
    value: "+17%"

### Exposing hidden work

Shadowing dispatchers revealed the amount of invisible labor required to keep routes on track. Agents stitched together spreadsheets, WhatsApp threads, and dashboards to understand what was happening. We catalogued every touchpoint and mapped the system dependencies.

### Building the shared map

We architected a data model linking shipments, vehicles, and sensors. Interfaces were designed as layered maps: overview, lane, and shipment. Each layer showed the health of the system with color-coded signals and narrative explanations.

### Automating triage

Using historical data, we defined thresholds for when a human needed to step in. We created playbooks that paired an alert with the owner, supporting data, and recommended actions. Framer Motion micro-interactions guided attention without overwhelming.

### Coaching the change

Rollout paired software with ritual. We led war-room rehearsals, built KPI scorecards, and coached teams on using the platform during daily stand-ups. Within a quarter, exception handling time halved and on-time deliveries climbed.
