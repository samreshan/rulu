When I say design is how it works, I’m pointing to the invisible choreography that turns intention into experience. The surface may sparkle, but if the underlying system is confusing, brittle, or misaligned with real-world behavior, the design has failed. The job is to orchestrate people, processes, and pixels so the intended outcome happens reliably.

Early in my career I obsessed over visual polish. But I noticed the most beautiful screens sometimes created the most chaos. Teams would ship a dazzling interface that looked right in Figma, yet frontline teams resorted to spreadsheets a week later. The gap wasn’t aesthetic — it was operational. Design hadn’t accounted for how information moved, who owned decisions, or what success actually meant.

So I began treating every project like a systems exercise. I map inputs, actors, and feedback loops before touching a layout. I ask what must be true for someone to feel confident taking the next step. I pay attention to constraints: the API we have, the culture we’re working inside, the time available to learn. That context shapes the craft.

This approach creates quieter, steadier products. It also shifts the conversation with founders. Instead of “make this screen pop,” we talk about unlocking behaviors: can the support team close tickets faster, can the patient understand the diagnosis, can the operator intervene before an issue snowballs? Once the outcome is clear, the design becomes the bridge.

The best compliment I’ve received was from an ops lead who said, “I forget your designs exist — I just notice my team moving faster.” That’s the aim. Design is successful when it disappears into momentum, when people feel the system working with them. The beauty follows the clarity.
